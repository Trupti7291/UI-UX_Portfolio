                    <h2>Discover</h2>
                    <p>A design focusing on Myflix app.</p>
                    <p>
                        Instead of diving headfirst into designing the app, I took the discovery route to address the
                        core
                        challenges of why Myflix was created in the first place and what
                        would motivate users to use the platform. Understanding the thoughts and emotions regarding
                        Myflix
                        is an essential
                        step in ensuring that the platform will be successful and that users will want to use it.
                        <br><br>
                        By following a process to discover and understand user needs and motivations, I can ensure that
                        Myflix app will meet
                        their needs and provide a valuable experience. This process can involve conducting user
                        research,
                        analyzing market
                        trends, and identifying user pain points and goals.
                        <br><br>
                        Taking this approach allows to validate if the project is something of interest to users, which
                        can
                        save the
                        time and resources in the long run. It also helps to create a user-centered design that
                        prioritizes
                        the needs
                        and preferences of the target audience.

                            Conducting a competitive analysis on existing mobile video streaming apps is an excellent
                            approach to understand the strengths and weaknesses of similar platforms in the market. By
                            analyzing apps like YouTube and Prime Videos, I can identify their pain points and
                            opportunities for improvement, which can help inform the design and development of my own
                            app.

                        <h4>User Research</h4>
                        <p>
                            Collecting quantitative data is an important step in the discovery phase of app development

                            it provides with
                            concrete insights into the preferences and behaviors of the target users.
                            To start, I need to identify target audience and their approaches to using the app. Once
                            having
                            a clear understanding
                            of target audience, I used tool like Google Survey, to ask them questions about their
                            preferences and behaviors. This can
                            include questions

                                Lora and Inter are great font choices for the Myflix app, as they are both highly
                                readable and versatile typefaces
                                that work well for both title and body text. Lora has a classic and elegant feel, which
                                makes it a great choice for headlines and
                                titles. Inter, on the other hand, is highly legible and has a neutral design that makes
                                it versatile for use in both labels
                                and body text. Inter's balanced and consistent letterforms also make it a great choice
                                for digital interfaces, as it
                                is easy to read on screens of different sizes and resolutions. The combination of Lora
                                and Inter can help create a cohesive and polished visual identity for the Myflix app,

                    <p>Reflecting on the UX design journey for Myflix in terms of what I've learned, what I can improve on, and why I started it. </p>
                    <h4>What I learned</h4>
                    <p> I have learned so much through the construction of Myflix, from implementing Material Design Guidelines to
                        collaborating with others to further improve Myflix. Letting go of designs and ideas that are not serving usability
                        purposes was difficult but essential for creating a better user experience. I, being open-minded and willing to
                        iterate based on user feedback was crucial for creating a user-centered design. I've gained valuable experience and
                        insights throughout this project Also learned that empathy is not a one-time action, but a continuous effort to
                        understand and meet the needs of the users.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="summary-content-item">
                    <p>
                        I sought, received, and listen to feedback and critique from others, but equally important to have confidence in my
                        own design choices and decisions. It's all about finding the right balance between being open to suggestions and
                        feedback, while also standing steadfast to my design vision and objectives. This is a skill I can be honed through
                        practice and experience, and it can ultimately lead to more potent and more effective design solutions.
